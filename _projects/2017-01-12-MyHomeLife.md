# My Home Life

## Promoting Quality of Life

<br/>
My Home Life is a UK-wide initiative that promotes quality of life and delivers positive change in care homes for older people. They are supported by all the national providers of residential care and the Relatives and Residents Association.

As part of EQtwo, we produced a vibrant and engaging redesign. We focused heavily on the user journey, producing a structure that is audience-centric and neatly organises the vast library of resources available.
