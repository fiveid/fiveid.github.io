# NGK Torque

## Blogzine for Petrolheads and Gearnuts

<br/>
Brand engagement website for NGK Spark Plugs UK Ltd. Website intended to amplify the client's passion and investment in all things automotive. A distinctive, magazine-line design and strong editorial feel was used to reach new audiences beyond the trade-centric, corporate website.

NGK Torque was a low-investment strategy, using organic SEO and social media visibility for traffic. Since launch, NGK Torque has received more than 60 times as many pageviews as the news section on the main NGK UK website.
