# Fly VLM

## International airline

<br/>
VLM Airlines was an international airline based in Belgium. In late 2014, they announced a number of new scheduled services operating between five European countries and asked EQtwo to create a brand new website incorporating a third-party booking engine.

The website went from concept to launch in three weeks. With the tight deadline, we opted for a staged iterative development development approach.

We iterated quickly. Functionality would go on to include the integration of a third-party booking system, localisation, newsletter registration and management, multi-part contact form for group bookings, as well as hotel search and car rental integration with third parties. We also tailored the CMS extensively to enable the creation of destination landing pages and a system and template for operating competitions.
