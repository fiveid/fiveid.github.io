VLM Airlines was an international airline based in Belgium. In late 2014, they announced a number of new scheduled services operating between five European countries and asked us to create a brand new website with booking engine. The first flights were due to take off only a few weeks later.

Due to the tight deadline, we knew we could not go live with all the functionality we wanted. Instead, we focused on the essential functionality at launch, with extra functionality to be added incrementally as part of an ongoing development plan. This allowed us to launch the site well within the timeframe.

We were always mindful of the bigger picture and, from the beginning, laid the foundations for future developments. The first big step was delivering localised content. We not only implemented translations in four languages, but also enabled locally targeted promotions and marketing messages.

We continued to develop the site throughout 2015, incorporating features and functionality laid out in the development plan as well as making ad hoc changes based on the clientâ€™s needs. In the end, functionality included the integration of a third-party booking system, localisation, newsletter registration and management, multi-part contact form for group bookings, as well as hotel search and car rental integration with third parties. We also tailored the CMS extensively to enable to creation of destination landing pages and a system and template for operating competitions.
