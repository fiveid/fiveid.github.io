# Paradigm Trust

## Multi-academy Trust

<br/>
Paradigm Trust has a very simple ethos: every child is entitled to an outstanding education, with equal access to knowledge, skills, opportunities, aspirations, life chances and dignity.

Our objectives: reusable template, tailored for the school’s “brand”, characterful, devise a site structure that's easy to navigate and easy to manage.

We aimed to develop a reusable template that would still retain the individual character of each school. We used prominent images and distinctive colour schemes to communicate each school’s unique personality. The design is flexible enough to be tailored for primary schools, secondary schools and the Paradigm Trust’s own website.

Equally as important as the look and feel was developing a new architecture. The existing school websites had no rules regarding the structure of site content and had grown unruly. We took the lead in creating a far more ordered and logical site structure based on our own informed understanding of the priorities and requirements of the schools. We presented our changes with the Trust, incorporated their feedback and were able to quickly agree on an architecture to act as the basis for all sites. After this, we were able to migrate the two original school websites to the new structure and onto the new platforms within just one week.

As of the beginning of 2017, there were six Paradigm Trust sites. At the launch of each site we populated and revised the content before handing control over to the Trust. We continued to optimise site performance after handover. Our optimisations ensured average page load time was 23% faster while the average page download time was almost 80% faster.

The main Paradigm Trust website used the same template, with a unique styling for differentiation.
