# Paradigm Trust

## Multi-academy Trust

<br/>
Paradigm Trust has a very simple ethos: every child is entitled to an outstanding education, with equal access to knowledge, skills, opportunities, aspirations, life chances and dignity. When Paradigm Trust launched, they needed a digital platform that would work for all future websites.

The objectives were to create a reusable, characterful theme, which could be tailored for the school’s specific identity and to devise a site structure that would be easy to navigate and, just as importantly, easy for the schools to manage and keep up to date.

Prominent images and distinctive colour schemes were used to communicate each school’s unique personality. The design is flexible enough to be tailored for primary schools, secondary schools and the Paradigm Trust’s own website.

Equally as important as the look and feel was developing a new architecture. I took the lead in creating a far more ordered and logical site structure based on our own informed understanding of the priorities and requirements of the schools.

Ongoing optimisations led to average page load time being 23% faster while the average page download time was almost 80% faster.

The main Paradigm Trust website used the same template, with a unique styling for differentiation.
