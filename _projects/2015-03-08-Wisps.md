# Wisp

## Phantoms from another world!

<br/>
This project (started in 2013) was an exercise in database management and delivering specific results based on geolocation. It uses a HTML5 web interface with a custom PHP backend.

## The Concept
All around us, invisible to our human eyes, are otherworldly creatures called **Wisps**. With the right equipment it may even be possible to detect and even capture these fantastical monsters…

The idea is that a user would enter their current location and be shown a list of “Wisps” native to that environment. Each Wisp would have a set of RPG-style characteristics based on whatever “species” they belong to.  

The user can “catch” one of the discovered Wisps and add it to their collection.

I worked on developing specific areas of this concept, drawing from a basic database of randomly generated monster classes. The more significant, functional parts of the project are listed below.

### Wisp Hunter

The monster finder takes a pair of coordinates (or uses your current location) to identify “biomes” pertinent to your real life region.  It then delivers a list of Wisps that belong to this region.

### Bestiary

A database management interface that allows me to update the characteristics of Wisp species. Changed fields are highlighted after submission.

### Related Projects
The requirement to create Wisp biomes that mirrored the real world led to the creation of the Gridmaker javascript plugin. Read more about it [here](https://github.com/fiveid/gmaps-gridlines){:target="_blank"}.
