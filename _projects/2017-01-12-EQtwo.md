# EQtwo

## Multidisciplinary agency

<br/>
I've worked for EQtwo since 2009 as Head of Digital. The role has both strategic and practical aspects. As the sole in-house developer, I've been responsible for producing dozens of websites and online tools for clients. But none were more challenging than the agency website!

In the end we designed and built two agency websites: the main website, showcasing a variety of work across media, and a spin-off microsite dedicated to digital.

The style is distinctive and visually bold with an unconventional structure. We attempted to communicate a wide-ranging portfolio as efficiently as possible.
