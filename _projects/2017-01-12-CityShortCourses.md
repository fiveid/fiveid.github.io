# City Short Courses

## Course Information Microsite

<br/>
We created a course info microsite for City University London to promote short courses. The microsite brought forward case studies, personal stories, and visual character, with more flexibility than was available on the main university website at the time.

During the first year of the City Short Courses website activity, alongside offline marketing, City University London saw an increase of 28% in bookings, and a decrease of over 60% in course cancellations.
