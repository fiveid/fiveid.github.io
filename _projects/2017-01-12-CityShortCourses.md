# City Short Courses

## Marketing Microsite

<br/>
Created a marketing microsite for City University London short courses, as part of a larger marketing push that featured online and offline aspects. The microsite was designed to be more engaging and flexible than the standard course search via the main website.

The microsite had a striking design and a user-centric structure that meant vital content was never more than a couple of page loads away. We incorporated emotive case studies, relatable stories, and visual character.

During the first year of website activity, City University London saw an increase of 28% in bookings and a decrease of over 60% in course cancellations.
